# Kenya University and Colleges Placements API.
As a continuation into my exporation of data that can be found on my website [sidneyochieng.co.ke](http://sidneyochieng.co.ke/)in the Kenyan education system I pulled data from the Kenya University and Colleges Central Placements Service(KUCCPS).

KUCCPS is tasked with determining which university and course students are placed in based on a number called a cutoff point(a combination of overall grade, subjects chosen and how well you performed in those subjects). Placement by KUCCPS means that you enter as a government sponsored student which means heavily subsidised by the government.

Details on how to calculate the cluster points can be found on this [page](https://www.nabiswa.com/kuccps-admission-list-20162017-cluster-points/) and the original data can be found as PDFs[here](http://schools.kuccps.net/centers_downloads.php) though I've included the data in this repository as csvs.

I've always found it ridiculous that someone has to send time calculating their cut off points by hand then going through sheets of paper to try find the courses they can do. This is my way of trying to fix that. First I want to build the core API then maybe I'll add a web endpoint or website front end. We'll see 

This project is a way for me to practice a bit of coding and system building. As a data scientist my work very rarely involves building things like this. I'll be trying to [blog](http://sidneyochieng.co.ke/) about the process of development when I can.
